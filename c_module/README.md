# C Module exposing USB capabilities to miccropython


Reddit question draft:
It feels like there are no in depth resources about how to generate mpy files. I can get the factorial example to compile and load fine, but I want to write C code to access the usb hardware since there doesn't seem to be a good way to do it otherwise. I got tinyusb to include in the project, but it complains about linker errors (LinkError: build/macro.o: undefined symbol: tusb_init) if I put it between MP_DYNRUNTIME_INIT_ENTRY and MP_DYNRUNTIME_INIT_EXIT. When I move it somewhere else, it gives a similar error (LinkError: build/tinyusb/src/common/*.o: undefined symbol: memcpy) about the memcpy function used within tinyusb. What should I do now? Is there a way I can get mpy_ld to include the pico stdlib? And is there any general resources I can use to find a way to use mpy_ld?
